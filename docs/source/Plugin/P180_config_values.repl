    ``<name>``: A name that doesn't match any of the configured Value names in the plugin, or ``log`` (see above).

    ``<I2C-commands>``: A sequence of I2C commands, as documented below, that will return a value.
    ","
    Returns the value remaining after executing the I2C commands.

    Should not use the ``value`` I2C command, as then the last value won't be returned here. Must be wrapped in quotes when the command sequence includes commas or spaces.

    ``delay`` I2C command is limited to 10 msec. similar to the 1ps/10ps/50ps events.
